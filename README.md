# CPSC 131 - Data Structures

This repository contains my coursework, projects, and notes for CPSC 131: Data Structures, a course offered by the Computer Science Department at California State University. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental data structures used in computer science.

## Course Description

CPSC 131 deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of classical data structures. It covers:

- Vectors and linked lists for sequential storage
- Stacks and queues for managing elements in a controlled order
- Binary search trees for efficient data sorting and retrieval
- Graph representations for complex networked data

The course emphasizes not just theoretical understanding but practical application, with a focus on worst-case, amortized analysis, and big-O notation. Through object-oriented programming, students learn recursive techniques and explore advanced structures such as self-resizing vectors and self-balancing trees.

## Learning Goals

Students will exit the course with:

- A solid grasp of different data structures and their appropriate use cases.
- The ability to perform empirical performance measurements and analyze the practical performance of data structures.
- Proficiency in the implementation of data structures using object-oriented programming.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills through the application of data structures to complex problems.

## Repository Contents

- `Projects`: Larger-scale works that integrate multiple data structures and algorithms.

Enjoy exploring and deepening your understanding of data structures!
