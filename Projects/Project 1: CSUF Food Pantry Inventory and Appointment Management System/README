# CSUF Food Pantry Inventory and Appointment Management System

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive management system for the California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) Food Pantry. The goal is to develop a robust software solution that assists in maintaining and tracking inventory for food donations and managing appointments for students utilizing the pantry services.

As new students contributing to this vital service, you'll enhance the provided starter code with additional functionality to manage inventory items and user appointments effectively.

## Inventory Management

Using template classes provided, you'll implement and extend the `Item` and `Inventory` classes with operations crucial for handling food pantry stocks. This includes adding new items, increasing item quantities, updating item details, removing items, and querying total inventory counts. Exception handling is crucial for ensuring data integrity and providing clear feedback during inventory operations.

## Appointment Management

In parallel, you will work on the appointment system, utilizing classes designed to handle appointment scheduling. Functions you will add include scheduling new appointments, calculating total appointments for given dates and times, and removing the most recent appointment. Proper checks to prevent double booking using a student's CWID will be implemented for better system reliability.

## Functional Requirements

- **Vector Operations**: Efficiently handle vector operations to ensure no duplicates, up-to-date item details, and accurate inventory levels.
- **Exception Handling**: Robustly deal with scenarios like non-existent items or appointments when performing updates or removals.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Follow the pre-written test cases in the main function to validate the functionality of your code additions without any modifications to the testing code.

This project is a real-world application of data structures learned in CPSC 131. It challenges students to apply their knowledge in vector implementation, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic problem-solving to make a tangible impact on their campus community.

Let's build a system that makes a difference!
